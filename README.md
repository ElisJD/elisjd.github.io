# Portfolio
I am Elis Davies, a dedicated MSc Geographic Data Science student at the University of Liverpool with a passion for applying data-driven solutions to solve complex challenges. This portfolio showcases my academic and professional projects, highlighting my skills in geospatial analysis, statistical modelling, machine learning, and data visualisation.

Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate my ability to interpret and analyse data, design innovative tools, and provide actionable insights across diverse domains.
